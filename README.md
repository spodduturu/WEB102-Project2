## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Building this app presents several challenges, including managing state and interactivity for smooth transitions between flashcards, ensuring the background image scales well across devices, and handling dynamic content like flag emojis. Designing visually distinct color-coded cards while maintaining readability can also be tricky, and implementing the flip animation of the flashcards requires precise synchronization. Randomizing flashcards without repetition, ensuring cross-browser compatibility, and managing performance with a growing number of cards all require careful attention. Additionally, maintaining a seamless user experience and UI consistency, while adding customization options, introduces further complexity. Testing and debugging to ensure smooth functionality is crucial as the app evolves.
